I'm a master student majoring in data journalism. This is my second semester in the journalism school of University of Missouri-Columbia. Currently I work as a research assistant at NICAR database library, using MySQL to update database.
Previously I've served as the director of China Current Network and interned in New York Times Chinese Edition and Wall Street Journal Beijing Bureau. I'm especially interested in data-driven, China-related story but have limited experience in real projects. So I hope to learn about Python and developing an investigative idea into a project in this class.
